/* quotes.js — the Quotation module's data.
 *
 * The shapes here are taken from Banavat India's actual quotation,
 * not invented. A quotation is a document before it is a record, so
 * the fields are the ones that appear on the page, in the order the
 * page prints them:
 *
 *   QUOTATION
 *   Client Name / Contact Number / Shipping Address
 *   Quoted Date / MR # / Valid till
 *   Sr.No | Image | Name | Description | Dimensions | Unit Price | Qty | Total
 *   Payment Terms
 *   Sub-Total → GST(18%) → Sub Total A
 *   Shipping rows → Sub Total B
 *   Sub Total A + Sub Total B = Total
 *   Banking details · Contact details · Terms & Conditions · Note
 *
 * Three things the real document taught us, each of which the first
 * draft of this file got wrong:
 *
 * 1. The MR number is the quotation's identity. There is no separate
 *    quote number — C128 *is* the quotation, and it is the same code
 *    the ledger already files jobs under. A revision appends a suffix
 *    (C129-1), so the original a client has seen keeps its meaning.
 *
 * 2. Dimensions are prose, not three numbers. Real entries read
 *    `38 x 1 x 58"`, `Dia 8 inch`, `(8'8" + 20'7.5" + 8'8") x 36" (Ht)`
 *    and `Small: 550 x 550 x 440 mm  Large: 890 x 890 x 340 mm`. No
 *    W/D/H triple survives contact with that, so the field is text.
 *
 * 3. Shipping is its own short table below the tax, not a line item
 *    and not a discount. Goods are taxed (Sub Total A); shipping is
 *    added after (Sub Total B); the two are summed for the Total.

/* ── The link into Phynance ────────────────────────────────────
   The MR number is already the job code — the ledger has filed
   entries under B121 and C123 since before this module existed. So
   accepting does not invent a code, it simply opens the job that
   the quotation has been named after all along.

   The figure that job opens with is not always this document's own
   total, in three ways staff actually approve a quotation:

     - as quoted — the job takes quoteTotals(q).total, same as before.
     - at a different figure — a client negotiates the number down
       (or up) from what was quoted. That agreed figure is not this
       document any more, so a sub-quotation is written under the
       next revision number carrying it, and *that* is what gets
       accepted and opened — the original stays exactly what was
       sent, superseded rather than silently rewritten.
     - excluding GST — some jobs are booked on the pre-tax figure,
       with the tax collected and accounted separately. The document
       is unchanged; only what Phynance is told to expect is smaller,
       and the quotation carries a flag so that is visible wherever
