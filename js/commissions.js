/* commissions.js — the people paid a cut, not a wage.
 *
 * Some work comes in through someone who is neither staff nor a
 * one-off subcontractor: an associate who refers a client and is
 * owed a percentage of what that job billed, or a maker like
 * Shapemaker who is both a client of some jobs and a commission
 * partner on others. Neither fits the Jobs screen — a job there is
 * money owed *to* Banavat India for work done, and this is money
 * owed *by* it, calculated off someone else's figure.
 *
 * A partner's own running total is never typed in — it is the sum
 * of their entries, the same way a job's outstanding figure is the
 * sum of its ledger entries, so the two can never drift apart.
 *
 * This module is local to the device for now, the way the whole app
 * was before Phynance and Quotation grew their own sync — see
 * quotesync.js if this needs to follow the same path later.
